Written in PHP, this scripts checks a webroot directory for malware. It searches for suspicious filenames, fingerprints in file contents and authenticates files using file hashes.

==Usage

==Todo
[ ] Centralized administration of search parameters
[ ] Namespacing all files

==Sources
Some sources I used to create this app are included in the src subdir.

Many thnx to the authors of those scripts :D
